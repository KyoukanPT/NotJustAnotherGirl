This project was made within the scope of <Academia de Código_>'s 2020 Hackathon Bitjs Edition.

It was built by the team GigaLoads composed by Tiago "Francês" Silva, Nuno Rodrigues, Willian "Will Will" Silva, Pedro "Puto" Cabral and Fábio "Jhost" Cardoso.

The theme of the Hackathon is about the protests during the covid pandemic.

Each group had to create a project based on the topic/lyrics of a random song. 

The song that was randomly chosen for us was "Just a Girl" from the band "No Doubt".

Since the song is written from the perspective of a girl who is frustrated with some people and with life in general, we decided to target the protest side of the song and incorporate it into our project idea. 

Our project aims for the defense of the women's rights and report complaints that victims have suffered and want justice.

This application is a web app, with a RESTfull backend ready to be implemented by other applications while our website implement said features.

With our app you can create an account, make a complaint and in the future you will have a user profile where you can see your complaints, check the number of complaints per location, and more.
